   * v1.7.2
   * Reduce file read syscalls and gain performance
   * Functional testing in python, for both view to stdout as mounting
   * Added templating for cleaner code
   * Auto conversion to fourbit if that is more efficient compression

2020-02-01  Youri Hoogstrate

   * v1.7.1
   * Fixed an errornous syscall (when `ls -l` requests a certain xattr
   * Set chmods to 0555 and 0777

2020-01-27  Youri Hoogstrate

   * v1.7.0
   * `fastafs cache -o` for custom output files and bypassing the config
   * Random access subsequence retrieval diretly via filesystem: `<mount>/seq/chr1:100-200`
   * Implements CRC32 checksums for whole-file integritity
   * Converting to meson because of insane build times using cmake+make and re-building files that have not changed
   * `fastafs view|mount -m/--no-masking` virtualises fasta files without masking (uppercase)
   * Minor support for building with meson and ninja
   * cmake template allows building for guix (+guix file provided)
   * Changed requirement from c++17 on c++14 to avoid large compatibility issues
   * Implements bitflags with corresponding class
   * Implements fourbit (and automatically switches over if non ACTGUN chars are found
   * Implements functions `is_fasta_file`, and `is_ucsc2bit_file` using file MAGIC
   * Creates by FASTAFS files that are first flagged as incomplete, that are unflagged after conversion has completed
   * MD5sums working for fourbit compressed sequences
   * Implements `fastafs cache -o` to export to desired output fastafs file
   * Adds compression type to `fastafs list` output
   * More and improved testing, including file integrity detection

2019-09-06  Youri Hoogstrate

    * v1.6.2
    * Rewritten argument parsing of fuse/mounting
    * Added binary `mount.fastafs` only for mounting, wihtout the toolkit
    * `fastafs --version` will now also output whether the binary was compiled as debug or release.

    * v1.6.1
    * Adds process' pid to `fastafs ps`

2019-08-21  Youri Hoogstrate

    * v1.6.0
    * `fastafs list` now supports view running instances of the fastafs files
    * function `lsfastafs()` allows finding all fuse mounted fastafs instances/mointpoints
      by making use of the 'fastafs-file'-xattr (`getfattr -n fastafs-file /mnt/fastafs/test`)
    * Adds `fastafs ps` listing all mounted fastafs instances and their corresponding
      mountpoints (also that are not present in the 'database').

2019-08-02  Youri Hoogstrate

    * v1.5.0
    * Support mounting 2bit files (without FASTAFS file(s))
       - Requires c++-17 for several std::filesystem calls

2019-06-05  Youri Hoogstrate

    * Changed SHA1 to MD5 hashes for BAM compatibility
    * Supports mounting `samtools dict` equivalent files
    * Hotfix for more than 255 M-blocks
    * Solves many warnings + various cleanups
    * Fixed some memleaks

2019-05-21  Youri Hoogstrate

    * Supports Masked regions (and conversion to/from UCSC TwoBit files)

2019-05-07  Youri Hoogstrate

    * Full support for UCSC TwoBit files in `fastafs cache` (adding to db)

2019-04-30  Youri Hoogstrate

    * Performance update.

2019-04-18  Youri Hoogstrate

    * The forwards conversion (fasta to fastafs) code has been improved
      and does not require to keep whole sequences in heap.

2019-04-11  Youri Hoogstrate

    * The file format has been re-specified, backwards incompatible with
      the test code. The fastafs to fasta projection has been enormously
      improved and is way and way faster.

2018-10-26  Youri Hoogstrate

    * fastafs_seq::sha1() is in concordance with CRAM standard; only
      uppercase nucleotide chars are taken into consideration

2018-01-17  Youri Hoogstrate

    * fastafs mount --padding 5 works

2018-01-10  Youri Hoogstrate

    * fastafs mount provides appropriate file size
      attributes resulting in correct files

2018-01-08  Youri Hoogstrate

    * fastafs mount now also virtualizes faidx files

2017-12-27  Youri Hoogstrate

    * Removal of some minor memory leaks

2017-12-22  Youri Hoogstrate

    * First working prototype of `fastafs`

    * fastafs cache

    * fastafs list

    * fastafs info

    * fastafs view

    * fastafs mount
